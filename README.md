# Agriculture-crop-Yield-Prediction
By segmenting soil into different clusters based on factors like pH level, nitrogen content, and phosphorus content, we can identify the most suitable crops for each soil type. The project helps optimize agricultural practices by providing insights into soil health, improving crop yield predictions, and aiding in efficient resource management.
